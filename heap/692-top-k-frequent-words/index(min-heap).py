""" Complexity Analysis

Time Complexity: O(Nlogk) 

where N is the length of words. We count the frequency of each word in O(N) time,
then we add N words to the heap, each in O(logk) time. 
Finally, we pop from the heap up to k times 
and sort all elements in the heap to retun the result, 
which takes O(k logk). As kâ‰¤N, O(N) + O(N logk ) + O(k logk ) = O(Nlogk)

Space Complexity: O(N), O(N) space is used to store our counter cnt while O(k) space is for the heap.
