### Object Oriented Programming
It is a programming paradigm that organizes the software design around data, rather than function or logic. It helps write simple, well-organized, and reusable code.

Data is a crucial element of OOP in program development.OOP breaks down a problem into multiple entities and builds data and functions around it. The entity prevents the data to be modified outside of it and doesn't allow the data to flow freely around the system.

### Basic Terminologies

Object: It's the representitive/working entitiy of a Class.

Class: A class is an abstract blueprintmodel used to create more specific, concrete objects.

Attributes: Characteristic of a class is attribute. It is defined directly in the class that are shared by all objects of the class

Method: It modifies a class state that would apply across all the instances of the class

### Four Principles of OOP

#### Encapsulation:

Encapsulation is the wrapping up/binding of data and function into a single unit called class. Data encapsulation is the most prominent feature of a class wherein the data is not accessible to the outside world, and only those functions wrapped inside the class can access it. These functions serve as the interface between the object’s data and the program. 
#### Abstraction
Hiding the details of complexity is called Abstraction. It uses simplified, high level tools, to access a complex object.
For example, you don’t have to know all the details of how the engine works to drive a car.

Abstraction also serves an important security role. By only displaying selected pieces of data, and only allowing data to be accessed through classes and modified through methods, we protect the data from exposure. To continue with the car example, you wouldn’t want an open gas tank while driving a car.

#### Inheritance
Inheritance allows classes to inherit features of parent class.Inheritance allows reusability of our code.

In this example, Car is the parent class and there are different kinds of cars but they share common attributes like wheel and methods like driving.

#### Polymorphism
Using polymorphism, objects can override shared parent behaviors, with specific child behaviors.Polymorphism allows the same method to execute different behaviors in two ways: method overriding and method overloading.
