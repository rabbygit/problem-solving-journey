 * [Problem ref]{@link  https://leetcode.com/problems/populating-next-right-pointers-in-each-node-ii/}
 * @description Populate each next pointer to point to its next right node. 
 * If there is no next right node, the next pointer should be set to NULL.
 * Initially, all next pointers are set to NULL

/**
 * 
 * Follow-up:
 * 1. You may only use constant extra space.
 * 2. The recursive approach is fine. You may assume implicit stack space does not count as extra space for this problem.
